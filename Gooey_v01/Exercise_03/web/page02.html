		<p>‘Jo! Jo! Where are you?’ cried Meg at the foot of the
		garret stairs.
		‘Here!’ answered a husky voice from above, and,
		running up, Meg found her sister eating apples and crying
		over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on
		an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window. This was
		Jo’s favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a
		dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the
		society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn’t mind her
		a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his
		hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear
		the news.
		‘Such fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from
		Mrs. Gardiner for tomorrow night!’ cried Meg, waving
		the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with
		girlish delight.
		‘‘Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and
		Miss Josephine at a little dance on New Year’s Eve.’
		Marmee is willing we should go, now what shall we
		wear?’ 
		‘What’s the use of asking that, when you know we
		shall wear our poplins, because we haven’t got anything
		else?’ answered Jo with her mouth full.
		‘If I only had a silk!’ sighed Meg. ‘Mother says I may
		when I’m eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting
		time to wait.’
		‘I’m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice
		enough for us. Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the
		burn and the tear in mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn
		shows badly, and I can’t take any out.’
		‘You must sit still all you can and keep your back out
		of sight. The front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for
		my hair, and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and
		my new slippers are lovely, and my gloves will do, though
		they aren’t as nice as I’d like.’

			You don’t need scores of suitors. You need only one… if he’s the right one.
		</p>
		
		<p>‘Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can’t get any
		new ones, so I shall have to go without,’ said Jo, who
		never troubled herself much about dress.
		‘You must have gloves, or I won’t go,’ cried Meg
		decidedly. ‘Gloves are more important than anything else.
		You can’t dance without them, and if you don’t I should
		be so mortified.’ ‘Then I’ll stay still. I don’t care much for
		company dancing. It’s no fun to go sailing round. I like to
		fly about and cut capers.’ 
		‘You can’t ask Mother for new ones, they are so
		expensive, and you are so careless. She said when you
		spoiled the others that she shouldn’t get you any more this
		winter. Can’t you make them do?’
		‘I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one
		will know how stained they are. That’s all I can do. No!
		I’ll tell you how we can manage, each wear one good one
		and carry a bad one. Don’t you see?’
		‘Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch
		my glove dreadfully,’ began Meg, whose gloves were a
		tender point with her.
		‘Then I’ll go without. I don’t care what people say!’
		cried Jo, taking up her book.
		‘You may have it, you may! Only don’t stain it, and do
		behave nicely. Don’t put your hands behind you, or stare,
		or say ‘Christopher Columbus!’ will you?’
		‘Don’t worry about me. I’ll be as prim ad I can and not
		get into any scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer
		your note, and let me finish this splendid story.’
		So Meg went away to ‘accept with thanks’, look over
		her dress, and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace
		frill, while Jo finished her story, her four apples, and had a
		game of romps with Scrabble. 
		On New Year’s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the
		two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder
		were absorbed in the all-important business of ‘getting
		ready for the party’. Simple as the toilets were, there was a
		great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking,
		and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the
		house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo
		undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot
		tongs.</p>
		
		<h2> I hate ordinary people! </h2>

		<p>Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom
		went to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it
		was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady,
		greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of
		her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease
		very soon, but Jo, who didn’t care much for girls or girlish
		gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the
		wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower
		garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates
		in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join
		them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She
		telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up
		so alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk
		to her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she
		was left alone. She could not roam about and amuse
		herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared
		at people rather forlornly till the dancing began.  </p>
