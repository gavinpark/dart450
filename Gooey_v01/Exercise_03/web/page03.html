		<h1> THATS MY SISTER</h1>	
		<img src="../images/alexa3.jpg">
		<p>Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the
		letter, while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah
		‘knocked up a couple of pies in case of company
		unexpected". A breath of fresh air seemed to blow
		through the house, and something better than sunshine
		brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel
		the hopeful change. Beth’s bird began to chirp again, and
		a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy’s bush in the
		window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual
		cheeriness, and every time the girls met, their pale faces
		broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering
		encouragingly, ‘Mother’s coming, dear! Mother’s coming!’
		Every one rejoiced but Beth. She lay in that heavy stupor,
		alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It
		was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and
		vacant, the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once
		smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept
		hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she
		say so, only rousing now and then to mutter, ‘Water!’ 
		with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. All
		day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting,
		hoping, and trusting in God and Mother, and all day the
		snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged
		slowly by. But night came at last, and every time the clock
		struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of the bed,
		looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour
		brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that
		some change, for better or worse, would probably take
		place about midnight, at which time he would return.
		Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the
		bed’s foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to
		and fro in the parlor, feeling that he would rather face a
		rebel battery than Mrs. March’s countenance as she
		entered. Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but
		staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made
		his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.
		The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to
		them as they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of
		powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.
		‘If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,’
		whispered Meg earnestly.
		‘If god spares Beth, I’ll try to love and serve Him all my
		life,’ answered Jo, with equal fervor. 
		‘I wish I had no heart, it aches so,’ sighed Meg, after a
		pause.
		‘If life is often as hard as this, I don’t see how we ever
		shall get through it,’ added her sister despondently.
		Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot
		themselves in watching Beth, for they fancied a change
		passed over her wan face. The house was still as death, and
		nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush.
		Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the
		pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An
		hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie’s quiet
		departure for the station. Another hour, still no one came,
		and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the
		way, or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted
		the girls.
		It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window
		thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet
		of snow, heard a movement by the bed, and turning
		quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother’s easy chair
		with her face hidden.

		<p>During one of her play hours she wrote out the
		important document as well as she could, with some help
		from Esther as to certain legal terms, and when the goodnatured
		Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt
		relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted
		as a second witness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs
		to amuse herself in one of the large chambers, and took
		Polly with her for company. In this room there was a
		wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with which
		Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite
		amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and
		parade up and down before the long mirror, making
		stately curtsies, and sweeping her train about with a rustle
		which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that
		she did not hear Laurie’s ring nor see his face peeping in at
		her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan
		and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink
		turban, contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and
		yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk carefully, 
		Little Women

		for she had on highheeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo
		afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in
		her gay suit, with Polly sidilng and bridling just behind
		her, imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally
		stopping to laugh or exclaim, ‘Ain’t we fine? Get along,
		you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! Ha!’
		Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of
		merriment, lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped
		and was graciously received.
		‘Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I
		want to consult you about a very serious matter,’ said
		Amy, when she had shown her splendor and driven Polly
		into a corner. ‘That bird is the trial of my life,’ she
		continued, removing the pink mountain from her head,
		while Laurie seated himself astride a chair. ‘Yesterday,
		when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a
		mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so
		I went to let him out, and found a big spider there. I
		poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase. Polly
		marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under
		the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his
		eye, ‘Come out and take a walk, my dear.’ I couldn’t help
		laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and
		scolded us both.’ </p>
		
		<h2> ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial.</h2>

		<p>Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.  </p>
