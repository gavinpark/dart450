		<h1> Thats ME</h1>	
		<img src="images/Juju-01.jpg">
		<p>As young readers like to know ‘how people look’, we
		will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the
		four sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while
		the December snow fell quietly without, and the fire
		crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable room,
		though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain,
		for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled
		the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses
		bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of
		home peace pervaded it.
		Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very
		pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft
		brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she
		was rather vain. Fifteen- year-old Jo was very tall, thin,
		and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never
		seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which
		were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a
		comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see
		everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful.
		Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually
		bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders
		had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes,
		and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was
		rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn’t like it. 
	
		Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy,
		smooth- haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy
		manner, a timid voice, and a ;peaceful expression which
		was seldom disturbed. Her father called her ‘Little Miss
		Tranquility’, and the name suited her excellently, for she
		seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only
		venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and
		loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important
		person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow
		maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her
		shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like
		a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters
		of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.
		The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth,
		Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the
		sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for
		Mother was coming, and everyone brightened to welcome
		her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy
		got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo
		forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers
		nearer to the blaze. </p>
		
		<p class="pull_quote">
			"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to show it."
		</p>
		
		<p>While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got
		her wet things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down
		in the easy chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy
		the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls flew about,
		trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way.
		Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set
		chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything
		she touched. Beth trotted to and fro between parlor
		kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to
		everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.
		As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with
		a particularly happy face, ‘I’ve got a treat for you after
		supper.’
		A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of
		sunshine. Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit
		she held, and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, ‘A letter! A
		letter! Three cheers for Father!’
		‘Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall
		get through the cold season better than we feared. He
		sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an
		especial message to you girls,’ said Mrs. March, patting her
		pocket as if she had got a treasure there. 
		‘Hurry and get done! Don’t stop to quirk your little
		finger and simper over your plate, Amy,’ cried Jo, choking
		on her tea and dropping her bread, butter side down, on
		the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.
		Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy
		corner and brood over the delight to come, till the others
		were ready.
		‘I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain
		when he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough
		for a soldier,’ said Meg warmly.
		‘Don’t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan—what’s
		its name? Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help
		him,’ exclaimed Jo, with a groan.
		‘It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat
		all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,’
		sighed Amy.
		‘When will he come home, Marmee? asked Beth, with
		a little quiver in her voice.
		‘Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will
		stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we
		won’t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be
		spared. Now come and hear the letter.’
		They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with
		Beth at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of 
		the chair, and Jo leaning on the back, where no one
		would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen
		to be touching. Very few letters were written in those
		hard times that were not touching, especially those which
		fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the
		hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness
		conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively
		descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news, and
		only at the end did the writer’s heart over-flow with
		fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home. </p>
		
		<h2> Let us be elegant or die! </h2>
		
		<p>The morning charities and ceremonies took so much
		time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations
		for the evening festivities. Being still too young to go
		often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford any
		great outlay for private performances, the girls put their
		wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention,
		made whatever they needed. Very clever were some of
		their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made
		of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper,
		gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles
		from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the same
		useful diamond shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids of
		preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the
		scene of many innocent revels.
		No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts
		to her heart’s content and took immense satisfaction in a
		pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend, who
		knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots, an old foil,
		and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some
		picture, were Jo’s chief treasures and appeared on all
		occasions. The smallness of the company made it necessary
		for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece,
		and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work
		they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking 
		Little Women
		29 of 861
		in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage
		besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a
		harmless amusement, and employed many hours which
		otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or spent in less
		profitable society. </p>
