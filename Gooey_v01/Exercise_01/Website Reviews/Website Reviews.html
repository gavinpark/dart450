	<h3>DESIGN 8/10</h3>
	<p>The landing page of this website, a library of editorial content from the online retailer is clearly laid out in a simple grid format. It is no frills and leaves the visual interest to the singular images leading to the editorials. Most of the editorials themselves follow a simple structure of Header, subheader and body text accompanied by large scale, extremely high resolution and often full bleed images. The entire site is responsive, stretching text and images to their max. </p>
	<H3>USABILITY 9/10</H3>
	<p>From a menu bar on the left hand side, the user can easily select a year to browse from 2014 to 2017. When hovering over each image of an editorial, the user has the option to click and be taken to the full editorial. </p>
	<h3>CREATIVITY 6/10</h3>
	<P>The recently appointed editor-in-chief Joerg Koch was clear with his plan of the brand by integrating much more editorial content into the Ssense site. The landing page for the editorial archive is pretty bland but the editorials themselves are vibrant, unusual and directional. </P>
	<H3>CONTENT 8/10</H3>
	<P>The content of the opening page is simple, each editorial has one main image to emulate the rest of the editorial, accompanied by the date it was published online, the title of the editorial and a very brief description. The content of each editorial is far ranging from the expected product shoots (which are interactive, giving customers the opportunity to “shop” an item they see in a given photograph by hovering over a small + sign.) to features on international artists, musicians and designers including photo editorials, interviews and found work.</P>

	<h3>DESIGN 8/10</h3>
	<p>The landing page is simply laid out, an interesting effect is the ripple that is formed by moving the cursor. The following page is a 360° menu ushering the user into different spaces. Inside these spaces the user can click on virtual objects that change shape and sound when triggered.  </p>
	<H3>USABILITY 7/10</H3>
	<p>The commands and controls are quite simple but obviously meticulously planned by the designer to guide the user through the space in a certain manner. Although it appears that the user has autonomy, it is not the case.  </p>
	<h3>CREATIVITY 9.5/10</h3>
	<P>This collaboration between I.d., well known for their stance in the art and fashion worlds, and Chanel, it is no surprise that this digital visualization is highly creative and striking. The use of vibrant colours, ambient music and sensual textures all lend their hand to the full experience of this sit. </P>
	<H3>CONTENT 8/10</H3>
	<P>Although it is an ad of some sort, it seems much more of an art piece that has been highly thought out. The idea of different virtual spaces is well executed. </P>

	<h3>DESIGN 6/10</h3>
	<p>This website offers a very minimalist layout, stripped down to only the essentials making it easy just how much money one owes. The top of the page features the logo of the province, a two dimensional trillium flower with the accompanying ‘Ontario’. Organized into neat columns and rows, most of the page is comprised of links to other pages. The design of the page is clearly not responsive, nor designed for a screen as big as mine at 27”.</p>
	<H3>USABILITY 9/10</H3>
	<p>The website is easily navigable, with a simple message centre and drop down menus with clearly laid out pages. 
	<h3>CREATIVITY 2/10</h3>
	<P>Creativity is kept to a bare minimum to keep with the ominous no-frills theme of the site. The colours navy and sky blue offset with fluorescent and pastel green were perhaps intentional to convey a feeling of pastoral calmness. This is not effective as it ends up jarring and unpleasant.  </P>
	<H3>CONTENT 10/10</H3>
	<P>Although the content of this bureaucratic site is quite depressing and banal, its all there in plain view offering all information a student needs to remind themselves of the debt they’re accumulating.  </P>
