		<h1>Essay</h1>
		<div>
		<p>In this project, we’ll take a look back at the events that took place throughout the late 20th Century that led to the uprising among Canadian queers, what led this marginalized group to organize, protest and riot. These demonstrations of defiance and outrange led to many of the successes and strides in championing queer rights. This timeline of events will include elements of photography, video, audio and print records of demonstrations that took place across Canada in reaction to discrimination against queer communities. </p><br>

		<p>Known as the first large-scale demonstration organized by gays in Canada, We Demand was a turning point for gay activism. On August 28th, 1971 nearly 100 people, organized by Toronto Gay Action, marched for 40 minutes in the pouring rain on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  
		Demonstrators were in support of a manifesto titled WE DEMAND published over four pages in the first issue of The Body Politic, including a list of 10 demands for the Canadian Government, such as:</p><br>

		<p>1. The removal of the nebulous terms "gross indecency" and "indecent act" from the Criminal Code and their replacement by a specific listing of offences, and the equalization of penalties for all remaining homosexual and heterosexual acts; and defining "in private" in the Criminal Code to mean "a condition of privacy.<br>
		2. Removal of "gross indecency" and "buggery" as grounds for indictment as a "dangerous sexual offender" and for vagrancy.<br>
		3. A uniform age of consent for all female and male homosexual and heterosexual acts.<br>
		4. The Immigration Act be amended so as to omit all references to homosexuals and "homosexualism."<br>
		5. The right of equal employment and promotion at all government levels for homosexuals. <br>
		6. The Divorce Act be amended so as to omit sodomy and homosexual acts as grounds for divorce; moreover in divorce cases homosexuality, per se, should not preclude the equal right of child custody.<br>
		7. The right of homosexuals to serve in the Armed Forces, and therefore the removal of provisions for convicting service personnel of conduct and / or acts legal under the Criminal Code; further the rescinding of policy statements reflecting on the homosexual. <br>
		8. To know if it is a policy of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to identify homosexuals within any area of government service and then question them concerning their sexuality and the sexuality of others; and if this is the policy we demand its immediate cessation and destruction of all records so obtained.<br>
		9. All legal rights for homosexuals which currently exist for heterosexuals.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>   <br> 
		</p><br>					

		<p>A year later, alongside the very first official Gay Pride Week in Toronto, 200 protesters held a march to Queen’s Park, where they would further demand recognition for homosexuals under the Ontario Human Rights Code. </p><br>

		<p>In February of 1976, two men locked lips on a busy Toronto intersection and shared a kiss. They were charged and eventually convicted with indecency.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  This unjust conviction sparked outrage and resulted in one of the most memorable demonstrations of the decade. Just days later, at the same intersection where the illegal kiss occurred, approximately 20 men held a kiss-in. With the Toronto Police and pedestrians as their audience, pairs of men engaged in kisses all at once. This didn’t result in any arrests, Tim McCaskell, one of the demonstrations organizers shares what he thinks the protest acheived, “On the one hand, it didn’t escalate into a kind of political battle in the courts (which is where the group was willing to take it if anyone had been charged). But on the other hand, the fact that we had done it and documented it, and that police hadn’t intervened, kind of undermined the notion that two men kissing was somehow an indecent act that needed to have legal intervention.” </p><br>

		<p>In Montreal, tensions also begin to rise between law enforcement and the gay community. The advent of the 1976 Olympic games initiates a “cleaning campaign” launched by the current mayor Jean Drapeau. It targets gay establishments by performing police raids. This leads to Quebec’s first major gay demonstration on June 19th of 1976.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>  A year later, in the winter of 1977, a huge raid of Montreal gay bar Truxx occurs and 140 men are arrested for “gross indecency”. With the support of 2000 supporters, a demonstration takes place in Montreal in opposition to these arrests and a defense committee is formed. In an surprising act of justice, on December 15th, 1977, the Quebec government passes Bill 88, becoming the first jurisdiction in the world offering legal protection to homosexuals by forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>  It takes five years, but in the early 1980’s 120 of these men are freed of all accusations. </p><br>

		<p>In the 6 months leading up to February 5th, 1981, the Toronto police had been conducting an undercover operation known as “Operation Soap”, a campaign to run a number of Toronto’s gay bathhouses out of business. On that night in February, 150 police officers, some in uniform and some plain clothed, raided four bathhouses, physically and verbally abused both staff and patrons and made 289 arrests on the grounds of indecency and prostitution.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>  They also inflicted thousands of dollars of damages to the property of these businesses. Following the raids, public outrage emerged immediately, public protests began the following day with over 3000 protesters flocking to the streets of Toronto. Two weeks later, a march which turned out more than 4000 supporters was held to demand an independent inquiry into the arrests and to end police brutality. It began at Toronto’s Queen’s Park and ending at the Toronto Police’s 52 Division and bolstered media attention. </p><br>

		<p>Nearly a decade later, in 1990, more violence targeted against the gay community erupted, this time in Montreal. On July 15th, outside a queer organized party called “Sex Garage”, waited police officers, ready to confront the party-goers. In outrage of the unwarranted arrests, many activists organized a sit-in for the following night, hundreds of people took a seat in the middle of St. Catherine’s street in front of Beaudry Metro Station, downtown Montreal.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>  The protesters, even in the face of a police riot squad, refused to move until the police department agreed to meet with representatives the following day to discuss the abuse endure the night before. When reps, along with protesters, showed up the next day at the police station in the middle of the afternoon for a peaceful discussion, they were greeted with a closed door, sharpshooters on the roof of the station and were quickly swarmed by over 50 helmeted riot police with billy clubs.  What followed was a gruesome scene of police brutality, protestors being beaten, kicked and even dragged by the hair.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> These protests launched discussions around police brutality and lead to the formation of the organization Lesbians and Gays Against Violence and later established the Divers/Cité Pride March. </p><br>

		<p>Flash forward two decades to Toronto’s 2016 Pride Parade, notable for its attendance of Justin Trudeau, the first Prime Minister to march in the parade. Midway through the parade, reminiscent of the protests of decades past, the Black Lives Matter group held a sit-in to protest the “Anti-Blackness” of the organized events.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>  One of the their most controversial demands was the removal of police floats from future Pride Parades. After much heated contention the organizers of the Pride march eventually agreed to the demands, this was met with heated debate. </p><br>

		<p>Through looking at different events throughout history and piecing together artifacts, its clear that without public protest, many strides that have been made in support of queer rights wouldn’t be possible. Injustices are still prevalent with marginalized queer communities and action still needs to be taken for progress to happen. Looking back on the successes of those who came before serves as a reminder and motivation to move forward. </p><br>
