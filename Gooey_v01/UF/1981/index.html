				In the 6 months leading up to February 5th, 1981, the Toronto police had been conducting an undercover operation known as “Operation Soap”, a campaign to run a number of Toronto’s gay bathhouses out of business. On that night in February, 150 police officers, some in uniform and some plain clothed, raided four bathhouses, physically and verbally abused both staff and patrons and made 289 arrests on the grounds of indecency and prostitution.  They also inflicted thousands of dollars of damages to the property of these businesses.

			<h3>
			Following the raids, public outrage emerged immediately, public protests began the following day with over 3000 protesters flocking to the streets of Toronto. Two weeks later, a march which turned out more than 4000 supporters was held to demand an independent inquiry into the arrests and to end police brutality. It began at Toronto’s Queen’s Park and ending at the Toronto Police’s 52 Division and bolstered media attention.
