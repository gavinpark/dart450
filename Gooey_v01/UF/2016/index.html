				Toronto’s 2016 Pride Parade, notable for its attendance of Justin Trudeau, the first Prime Minister to march in the parade. Midway through the parade, reminiscent of the protests of decades past, the Black Lives Matter group held a sit-in to protest marginalization of people of colour and the presence of police officers in the organized events.

				One of the their most controversial demands was the removal of police floats from future Pride Parades. After much heated contention, the organizers of the Pride march eventually agreed to the demands, this was met with heated debate. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Some of the demands include:
				<br>
				<br>
				Continued space, including stage and tents, funding and logistical support for Black Queer Youth.
				<br><br>
				Prioritizing of the hiring of Black transwomen, Indigenous people and others from vulnerable communities at Pride Toronto.
				<br><br>
				Self-determination for all community spaces at Pride, allowing community groups full control over hiring, content and structure of their stages.
				<br><br>
				A condemnation of Toronto Police’s excessive use of force and and ongoing intimidation and harassment tactics against Black Lives Matter-Toronto protesters.
