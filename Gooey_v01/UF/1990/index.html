				In 1990, more violence targeted against the gay community erupted, this time in Montreal. On July 15th, outside a queer organized party called “Sex Garage”, waited police officers, ready to confront the party-goers. Luckily some of the violence was documented by photographer Linda Dawn Hammond.

			<h3>
				In outrage of the unwarranted arrests, many activists organized a sit-in for the following night, hundreds of people took a seat in the middle of St. Catherine’s street in front of Beaudry Metro Station, downtown Montreal.  The protesters, even in the face of a police riot squad, refused to move until the police department agreed to meet with representatives the following day to discuss the abuse endure the night before. When reps, along with protesters, showed up the next day at the police station in the middle of the afternoon for a peaceful discussion, they were greeted with a closed door, sharpshooters on the roof of the station and were quickly swarmed by over 50 helmeted riot police with billy clubs.  What followed was a gruesome scene of police brutality, protestors being beaten, kicked and even dragged by the hair . These protests launched discussions around police brutality and lead to the formation of the organization Lesbians and Gays Against Violence and later established the Divers/Cité Pride March.
