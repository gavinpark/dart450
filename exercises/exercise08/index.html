    Relax. Don't go so quickly. pay attention to this moment, slow your cursor. What is waiting for you at the bottom of the page? It will still be there once you've taken your time to read what I have to say. When computers become increasingly ubiquitous,
some of them will turn from being tools
explicitly used in specific situations to being
more or less continuously present as a part of a
designed environment. One of the aspects of this
transition is that the time perspective changes
from simply encompassing the moment of
explicit use to the longer periods of time
associated with dwelling. We can compare this
with the use of a chair: designing only for the
situation when a person is actually sitting down
is quite different from designing for the long
periods of time during which people only sometimes
sit down in the chair, when the chair is
used as a part of the environment. The second
case implies that not only the affordance of being
able to sit upon is of relevance, but also the
aesthetics of its design, its integration with the
rest of the environment, etc.
