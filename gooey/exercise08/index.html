    In the age of hypertext, online objects are only meaningful to humans, not to machines. However, in the age of metadata, online objects are considered to be meaningful to both machines and humans. Machines understand the semantic meaning of objects via the structures given to the metadata. This objectification movement is called the semantic web, introduced by Tim Berners- Lee in 2001. Berners- Lee argued that “in the future, when the metadata languages and engines are more developed, it should also form a strong basis for a web of machine understandable information about anything: about the people, things, concepts and ideas.”
