The goal of this project is to provide a moment of respite and levity for myself and others from the often overwhelming feelings of self-doubt catalyzed by the obtrusive interfaces of social media. This site will give an opportunity for the viewer to interact with a number of texts that are designed to be fun, affirming and offer a sense of ease.

The page consists of three positive affirmations that I often repeat to myself when I feel myself spinning. Using variables based on the date and time, each of these affirmations will appear at a different time of day and contain unique CSS and JQuery treatments that reflect their meaning.

You are exactly where you are supposed to be.
	Dividing the phrase with .blast(), each letter will be autonomous. With a mouse rollover, they will disperse to random locations on the page, only to retrace their path and eventually land back at their starting point, rebuilding the phrase.

Remember when you wanted what you currently have.
	Dividing the phrase with .blast(), on the rollover of the mouse, each word will nearly disappear, fading to an opacity of 5%. After 6 seconds, each word will gradually regain itâ€™s opacity.

Do not rush your come up.
	Dividing the phrase with .blast() and applying variables that control the speed of the animation, each letter will start at the bottom of the page and on the rollover of the mouse will float to the top of the page and form the phrase.

Using an array of colours and a slowly transitioning setInterval function, the background will change very slowly, almost without detection to the viewer. The colours employed will not be the traditionally pastel tones we are used to seeing in sites designed to be relaxing, rather saturated tones such as mustard yellow, moss green and puce, colours that are interesting but not jarring.
This is my DART 450 repository.
